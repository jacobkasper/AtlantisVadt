The visualising [Atlantis](http://atlantis.cmar.csiro.au/) toolbox, `vat`, was created by Christopher David Desjardins at the [Science Institute at the University of Iceland](http://raunvis.hi.is/rhformE.php) as a part of the [EU MareFrame project](http://www.mareframe-fp7.org/) with code contributions from Vidette McGregor at [NIWA](http://www.niwa.co.nz/) Erla Sturludottir at the [Agricultural University of Iceland](http://raunvis.hi.is/rhformE.php) and Jacob Kasper at the Agricultural University of Iceland.  

`vat` is released under the [GPL v3 or later](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) and source code is available at [http://github.com/mareframe/vat](http://github.com/mareframe/vat).

At present, `vat` is able to:
- Display within and across box distributions for functional groups by age classes.
- An interactive plot for the various functional groups and tracers in the model.
- Animated spatial biomass plots.
- Disaggregated plots (SN, RN, total numbers, proportion of numbers, length-at-age, and total biomass) by nitrogen or wet weight for the vertebrate functional groups.
- Diet data by predator and by prey.
- Biological summary data.
- Fishing by species and fishery over time.
- Reference plots for Biomass, SSB, NAA (numbers at age), and harvest for user defined groups from observed estimates can be displayed by using the files in the observation templates directory. The reference lines are displayed in light grey.
